MIMO-OFDM Wireless Communications with MATLAB, code and book in IEEE
====

Written for senior undergraduate and graduate students, this book provides a comprehensive introduction to the theory and practice of wireless channel modeling, OFDM, and MIMO, using MATLAB programs to simulate the various techniques on MIMO-OFDM systems. The book covers implementation to help cement the key concepts and uses materials that have been classroom-tested at numerous universities. Topics include large-scale fading, general path loss models, parameters for small-scale fading, and time-dispersive vs. frequency-dispersive fading.
